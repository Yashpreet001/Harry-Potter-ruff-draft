<h1> Plots </h1>
<hr>
<h4>Characters:</h4>

<h5>Protagonist - Harry Potter</h5> 

<h5>Antagonist - Lord Voldemort</h5> 

<h5>Static Characters - The Dursleys, Hermione, Ron, Hagrid, Malfoy and so on</h5>


<h4>Exposition:</h4> 

<p1>The storey of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone began on London's Privet Drive. The Dursleys, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, and Dudley, their son, were introduced in the opening scene of the play. The Dursleys tried to pass themselves off as a normal family from the London suburbs. Harry Potter, the Dursleys' nephew and primary character, had been kidnapped. The Dursleys disliked and ridiculed Harry for reasons unbeknownst to him.</p1>
<br><br>
<p2>Harry's parents were slain by Voldemort, the most evil wizard of all time, when he was a child. Voldemort attempted to murder Harry after his parents were dead, but he failed, leaving Harry with a lightning bolt scar on his forehead.</p2>
<br><br>
<p3>Harry's actual character was exposed when he reached the magical age of eleven, and he found he has magical abilities. In Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he discovered a friend who had firsthand knowledge of the events that led to Harry's parents' deaths. Harry makes bonds with Ron, a loyal and devoted buddy, and Hermione, a clever lady with a remarkable personality, while at Hogwarts.</p3>
<br><br>
 
<h4>Main Conflict:</h4>

<p4>Someone tried to take the Sorcerer's Stone, which provides its bearer perpetual life and the power to turn any metal into gold.</p4>

<h4>Side Conflict:</h4>

<p5>Snape, Harry assumed, was attempting to take the stone. Snape was Hogwarts' positions professor.</p5>

<h4>Rising Acting:</h4>

<p6>Harry was raised by his aunt and uncle, who were cruel to him. He was treated as if he were a regular housemaid rather than a member of the family. Harry's aunt and uncle never told him he was a wizard, preferring to assume he was a freak.</p6>
<br><br>
<p7>"You knew?" Said Harry. "you knew I'm a - a Wizard?" "knew! Of course we knew! I knew you'd be the same, just as strange, just as - as - abnormal." (pieces of pg. 53)</p7>
<br><br>
<p8>Professor Snape, Hogwarts' potions instructor, was accused of attempting to steal the sorcerer's stone, which may offer its bearer perpetual life. As a result, Harry, Hermione, and Ron keep a close check on Snape in order to prevent him from obtaining the stone.</p8>
<br><br>
<p9>"Snape wants the stone for Voldemort." (pg 260)</p9>

<h4>Climax:</h4>
<p10>On page 288, Harry arrived at the location of the Sorcerer's Stone. There, he discovered that Professor Quirrell, Hogwarts' Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, was the one chasing the stone, not Professor Snape, as Harry had imagined. We learned on page 294 that Quirrell was not attempting to take the stone for himself. He was attempting to take it in order to give it to Voldemort, the wicked wizard who killed Harry's parents. Quirrell then unwraped his turban, revealing the visage of Voldemort on the back of his head.</p10>
<br><br>
<p11>"Where there should have been a back to Quirrell's head, there was a face, the most terrible face Harry had ever seen." (pg. 293)</p11>

<h4>Falling Action:</h4>

<p12>Voldemort tried to persuade Harry to hand up the stone to him. Voldemort ordered Quirrell to murder Harry if he refuseed. Harry instantly grasped Quirrell's face when Quirrell attempted to hex Harry with his wand.</p12>
<br><br>
<p13>"AAAARGH! Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering." (pg. 294)</p13>
<br><br>
<p14>Quirrell couldn't touch Harry's exposed flesh without getting burned, as Harry learned. This was taken advantage of by Harry, who grasped Quirrell's bare arm as tightly as he could.</p14>
<br><br>
<p15>Before losing unconscious due to agonising agony, Harry recalled hearing Quirrell scream in pain and Voldemort instructing Quirrell to "KILL HIM!" (pg. 295).</p15>
<br><br>
<p16>Dumbledore greeted Harry after he awakens in the infirmary, explaining what happened after he lost consciousness while fighting Voldemort and Quirrell.</p16>

<h4>Resolution:</h4>

<p17>According to Dumbledore, Voldemort had been beaten, but he could yet reclaim his power.</p17>
<br><br>
<p18>Dumbledore was the one who destroyed the stone. "As for the stone, it has been destroyed." - Dumbledore (pg. 297)</p18>
<br><br>
<p19>House points were awarded to Harry, Hermione, Ron, and Neville for their courage in obtaining the stone that grants Gryffindor the House Cup, which marks the year's victorious house. (pg 306–307)</p19>
