  <h3><u>Love</u></h3>

<p1>In "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," as well as the subsequent books in the series, love plays an important part. Rowling emphasises the importance of love from the start of the storey, revealing that Harry's ability to withstand Voldemort's deadly curse is due to his mother's love. Lily Potter granted Harry a magical sort of protection by giving her own life to rescue his, shielding him from Voldemort's curse and nearly destroying the dark wizard. Voldemort is incapable of comprehending love, as Professor Dumbledore claims, especially in compared to the intensity of his own dark power, hence Lily's sacrifice caught him completely off guard.</p1>
<br><br>
<p2>Harry's capacity to love and be loved is one of the most distinguishing characteristics that sets him apart from Voldemort and ensures that he will never be lured by the Dark Arts. Harry's love for his parents inspires him to fight Voldemort and rebel against everything affiliated with the Dark Arts (thus Harry's reluctance to be put into Slytherin House). Harry's capacity to love has given him a network of friends that Voldemort will never be able to match.</p2>

<h3><u>Choice</u></h3>

<p3>The notion of choice and free will is one of the most fundamental issues that Rowling tackles in the novel. Rowling highlights several strange parallels between Harry and Voldemort right from the opening of the book: their twin wands, their link to snakes, and even some parts of their looks. In some ways, Harry seemed destined to follow in Voldemort's footsteps, as seen by the Sorting Hat's first decision to place Harry in Slytherin House. Harry, on the other hand, refuses to be a bystander when it comes to his own destiny, especially when it means following the road blazed by the terrible wizard who murdered his parents. As a result, rather than accepting the Sorting Hat's judgement, Harry refuses to be assigned to Slytherin House and is instead sent to Gryffindor House.</p3>
<br><br>
<p4>As Professor Dumbledore explains to Harry later, an individual's decisions define what sort of person they are and what kind of person they will become. When it comes to an individual's destiny, nothing is set in stone, but as Harry proves, each individual has the ability to change the course of their life by making big, as well as trivial, choices.</p4>

<h3><u>Humility</u></h3>

<p5>Harry's humility is one of the key characteristics that distinguishes him from the book's more malicious characters, like as Voldemort and Draco Malfoy. Harry maintains a humble character throughout the novel, despite his fame as the boy-who-lived and his Quidditch talents. In fact, he feels uncomfortable and nervous because of the additional attention he receives as a result of his upbringing; he believes he will never be unique enough to be worthy of such a prestigious reputation. Harry's humility stems in part from his mistreatment as a kid by the Dursleys. Because he was never regarded as a special person, Harry grew up with the concept that respect is earned rather than given. Dumbledore knew Harry would be abused when he left him with the Dursleys.He also knew that by growing up outside of the wizarding world, where he would have been put on a pedestal, he was ensuring that Harry would not be ruined by pride and arrogance.</p5>
<br><br>
<p6>When Harry confronts Voldemort in the dungeons of Hogwarts, his humility becomes a major theme of the novel. Voldemort and Professor Quirrell are both unable to recover the Sorcerer's Stone from the Mirror of Erised because they are both considering how the Stone may be used to benefit them. Harry, on the other hand, only thinks of obtaining the Stone in order to free others from Voldemort's tyranny; his modest character would never allow him to use the Sorcerer's Stone for his own selfish objectives.<p6>

<h3><u>The Importance of Rebellion</u></h3>

<p7>In "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Harry, Ron, and Hermione disobey several school regulations in order to pursue their adventures. Harry, in particular, is constantly prepared to breach a Hogwarts rule in order to act or do what he feels is right. Although Rowling acknowledges that the regulations set at Hogwarts are in place to keep the children safe, she portrays Harry's disobedience as a noble attribute in his character. He is capable of thinking for himself and, depending on the scenario, making decisions that might save lives. Furthermore, Harry is fully happy to suffer the ramifications of his disobedience as long as he is able to act when he is able.</p7>
<br><br>
<p8>It's worth noting that Harry never defies regulations just for the pleasure of breaking them; he only does so when he sincerely feels his actions are required. His motives for breaching the rules reflect his unselfish and loving personality (which contrasts dramatically with Lord Voldemort's). One of the first regulations Harry breaches is when he flies after Malfoy in order to collect Neville's Remembrall during his flying lesson with Madam Hooch. To show off, Harry does not ignore Madam Hooch's direct commands; instead, he defies the rules in order to reclaim the present that Neville got from his grandmother.</p8>

<h3><u>Death</u></h3>

<p9>"Death is simply the next big adventure," Professor Dumbledore informs Harry at the end of the book. Death, according to Rowling, is not something to be feared or dreaded, but rather a natural aspect of existence that should be accepted as a part of one's humanity. Death may also be considered as a beautiful thing. Lily Potter, for example, provided Harry the wonderful safety of her love and an opportunity at a life free of Voldemort's oppression by giving her own life for him. Her death gave Harry a sense of purpose in life, as well as the will to stop Voldemort from killing other people.</p9>
<br><br>
<p10>Despite the fact that none of the main characters die throughout the course of the novel, Rowling clearly distinguishes between death's natural process and Voldemort's deranged attempts to "beat" it and achieve immortality. Voldemort spent the next 10 years as "shadow and mist," neither dead nor alive, after his unsuccessful attempt to murder Harry. Voldemort achieves a warped sort of immortality, but his reluctance to accept the natural order of life and death exposes his wicked character and further separates him from Harry.</p10>

<h3><u>Friendship</u></h3>

<p11>Rowling emphasises the significance of friendship throughout the novel, particularly when it comes to conquering hurdles and tough jobs. Harry is utterly alone before he arrives at Hogwarts. He not only does not have a loving family, but he also does not have any friends to lean on for support. However, after enrolling at Hogwarts, Harry immediately makes a huge number of friends, as well as a close bond with Ron and Hermione. A solid network of friends helps most Hogwarts students cope with homesickness and challenging academics. Rowling makes a more evident link between friendship and significant life problems in Harry's case: Harry can only reach the Mirror of Erised in the Hogwarts dungeons with the aid of Ron and Hermione.Professor McGonagall's challenge of the gigantic wizarding chess and Professor Snape's challenge of the potions are two difficulties that Hermione and Ron take on that Harry would not have been able to face on his alone. Harry's relationship with Ron and Hermione saves his life and helps him to prevent Voldemort from discovering the Sorcerer's Stone in this circumstance.</p11>
<br><br>
<p12>Harry's bond with Ron and Hermione is important because it further differentiates him from Voldemort. Despite the fact that Voldemort is significantly more powerful than Harry, he prefers to remain alone and unaffected by his surroundings. Voldemort is nothing more than a servant to Professor Quirrell, who consumes unicorn blood for him. Voldemort is constantly alone and has only himself to rely on since he lacks the capacity to build enduring friendships. Harry, on the other hand, can rely on himself while still relying on his close friends' support system and outstanding magical abilities.</p12>

<h3><u>Power</u></h3>

<p13>Another distinct feature between Harry and Voldemort is the idea of power. During his reign of terror over Britain, Voldemort's main ambition was to gain ultimate dominance over both the wizarding and Muggle communities. Even when his backfiring killing spell nearly kills him, Voldemort's goal remains the same: to gain ultimate control, first by taking the Sorcerer's Stone and using the elixir of life to create a new body, and second, to return to the heights of tyranny he enjoyed before his collapse. On the other hand, Harry has no desire to attain ultimate authority. His humble and pure personality drives him to crave just the companionship of his long-lost parents, as well as a bit less attention from others around him. In actuality, Harry is able to retrieve the Sorcerer's Stone from within the Mirror of Erised because he does not crave power: Professor Quirrell and Voldemort both want to use the Stone to acquire power.</p13>
<br><br>
<p14>In terms of power, Rowling uses Professor Dumbledore as a counterpoint to Voldemort. Professor Dumbledore is a highly competent wizard who, according to Rowling, is the only wizard who actually frightens Voldemort. Dumbledore, on the other hand, is unable of being corrupted by power, and instead uses his immense magical knowledge to take control and rule others around him. He merely wants the power to mould young witches and wizards so that they can use their magic safely and for the sake of society.</p14>
