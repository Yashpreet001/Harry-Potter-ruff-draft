<hr>


 <p1> On his way to work one day, Mr. Dursley (Vernon Dursley), a wealthy Englishman, witnessed a weird occurrence. Outside the Dursley house that night, Albus Dumbledore, the head of Hogwarts, met Professor McGonagall, who also taught at Hogwarts, and a giant named Hagrid. Dumbledore informed McGonagall that a man named Voldemort assassinated Mr. and Mrs. Potter and attempted but failed to assassinate their infant son, Harry. Dumbledore placed an explanation note in a basket in front of the Dursley house for Harry. </p1>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p2>After ten years, the Dursley family is ruled by Dudley, the Dursleys' son, who torments and taunts Harry. Dudley was pampered, while Harry is confined to a closet beneath the stairs. On Dudley's birthday, at the zoo, the glass in front of a boa constrictor display vanishes, terrifying everyone. That event led to Harry's punishment.
</p2>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p3>Harry began to get mysterious letters. Mr. Dursley was concerned about them, and he attempted to hide them from Harry, but the letters continued to arrive through every opening in the house. Finally, on the eve of Harry's eleventh birthday, he and his family leave for an isolated island hut. They hear a loud bang on the door around midnight, and Hagrid enters. Hagrid presented Harry with a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry discovered that the Dursleys had been denying Harry's witchcraft for years.
 </p3>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p4>Hagrid brought Harry to London the next day to purchase school supplies. They first headed to Gringotts, a wizard bank, where Harry discovered that his parents have given him a large sum of money. They shop on Diagon Alley, the wizards' commercial district, where Harry was fitted for his school attire. Harry purchased books, potion ingredients, and, lastly, a magic wand—the villain Voldemort's companion wand.
</p4>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p5>Harry walked to the railway station a month later and boarded the train to Hogwarts on track nine and three quarters. Harry made friends with other first-year students on the train, including Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, a Muggle girl who was chosen to attend Hogwarts. The first-years at school take turns wearing the "Sorting Hat" to choose which residential home they will live in. Despite Harry's worries about being allocated to the nasty Slytherin house, he, Ron, and Hermione were placed in the honourable Gryffindor house.
</p5>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p6>As the new school year began, Harry learned that his Potions professor, Snape, didn’t seem to like him. Snape had no cause to loathe Harry, according to Hagrid. The students were instructed to remain grounded during their first broomstick flying session while the teacher transports an injured youngster called Neville to the hospital. Slytherin thug Draco Malfoy stole Neville's cherished toy and flies it to the top of a tree. Harry chased him down. Malfoy tossed the ball into the air, and Harry dived to make a fantastic grab. Professor McGonagall is there during the event. Instead of penalizing Harry, she suggested that he join Gryffindor and play Quidditch, a popular sport that resembles soccer on broomsticks. Malfoy challenged Harry to a midnight wizard's battle later that day. Malfoy failed to appear at the scheduled time, putting Harry in jeopardy. He encounters a vicious three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor in the prohibited third-floor passage while attempting to hide.
</p6>
<br>
<br>
<p7>A troll was discovered in the building on Halloween. The students were all brought back to their dorms, but Harry and Ron sneaked out to visit Hermione, who was alone and uninformed about the troll. They unwittingly locked the troll and Hermione in the girls' restroom. They vanquish the troll as a team. To keep Harry and Ron from being punished, Hermione tells a falsehood. Harry's broom jerks out of control during his first Quidditch match. Snape was looking at Harry and whispering a curse, which Hermione noticed. She came to the conclusion that he was jinxing Harry's broom and set Snape's garments on fire. Harry reclaimed possession of the broom and won the Quidditch match with a magnificent move.
</p7>
<br>
<br>
<p8>Hagrid won a dragon egg in a poker game a few weeks later. Because owning dragons is forbidden, Harry, Ron, and Hermione called Ron's elder brother, who was a dragon expert. They devised a plan to slay the monster, but they were apprehended. Gryffindor was fined 150 points, and Harry, Ron, and Hermione were harshly chastised. Furthermore, part of their punishment was accompanying Hagrid into the magical forest to discover who has been murdering unicorns recently. Harry came into a cloaked guy sipping unicorn blood in the woods. The guy attacked Harry, but he was saved by a sympathetic centaur, who informed him that his adversary was Voldemort. Voldemort had been attempting to take the Sorcerer's Stone, Harry discovers.
</p8>
<br>
<br>
<p9>Harry made the decision to locate the stone before Voldemort does. That night, he, Ron, and Hermione slip away to the prohibited third-floor hallway. As they approached closer to the stone, they got past the guard dog and execute a series of spectacular feats. Harry eventually came face to face with Quirrell, who informed him that he must die. Quirrell placed Harry in front of the Mirror of Erised and forced him to say what he sees, knowing that he wants to discover the stone. Harry sees himself with the stone in his pocket and feels it in his pocket at the same time. However, he informed Quirrell that he notices something else. Quirrell was told by a voice that the youngster was lying and that he should talk with Harry face to face. Quirrell took off his turban, revealing the visage of Voldemort on the back of his skull. Quirrell was ordered to murder Harry by Voldemort, who was residing in Quirrell's body, but Quirrell was burnt by touch with the youngster. After a tussle, Harry passes out.
</p9>
<br>
<br>
<p10>Harry was in the hospital with Dumbledore when he regained consciousness. Dumbledore said that he saved Harry barely in time from Quirrell. He goes on to say that he and Flamel have made the decision to destroy the stone. Harry made his way down to the end-of-year celebration, where Slytherin was celebrating their seventh straight house championship cup victory. Dumbledore raised and bestowed several last-minute points on Gryffindor in recognition of Harry's and his friends' achievements, ensuring Gryffindor's victory in the house cup. Harry comes to London for the summer to spend time with the Dursley family.
